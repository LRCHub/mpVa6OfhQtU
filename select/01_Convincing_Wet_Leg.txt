Gone with the wind
Taken by a heathen
Like an April fool was in 2007
Sun goes down every night
No goodbyes, I'm not surprised
I'm left with a lady in ruins
Uh-oh, convincing
Uh-oh, yourself
This is fine
Oh no, it's not working for you darling
They're outside of my house right now
And I wanna go outside and not see your name or his fucking face
Do you think the other girls would mind?
I took a swim too in the nighttime
On the beach, wet feet
Bioluminescent plankton shit
Uh-oh, convincing
Uh-oh, yourself
This is fine
Oh no, it's not working for you darling
Uh-oh, convincing
Uh-oh, yourself
This is fine
Oh no, it's not working for you darling
And the sky is blue (blue, ooh, ooh)
Do you feel it too? (Too, ooh, ooh)
And when the sky is grey? (Grey, ayy, ayy)
Uh-huh, I feel the same
Uh-oh, convincing
Uh-oh, yourself
This is fine
Oh no, it's not working for you darling
Uh-oh, convincing
Uh-oh, yourself
This is fine
Oh no, it's not working for you darling
