Maybe this is all just a projection
Maybe there was never a connection
We were always walking in two different directions
I was just an option, not your object of affection

Dancing at your oldest sister's wedding
We drank too much but I can still remember
I was getting dizzy and all at once it hit me
Something 'bout the way I felt was so disorienting

I wish I could get back all of that time
I wish I never found out what it's like
To love someone and lose 'em
I feel so fucking stupid
What a convincing illusion
What a convincing illusion

Maybe you were bad at being honest
Maybe I took the whole thing out of context
I tried my best to blame you and I hate that I can't hate you
It's nobody's fault you couldn't fall the way I wanted

I wish I could get back all of that time (all of that time)
I wish I never found out what it's like
To love someone and lose 'em
I feel so fucking stupid
What a convincing illusion (what a convincing illusion)
What a convincing illusion

Sometimes I wish that you'd still call me up
Say that I don't, but I still give a fuck about you
When I'm not around you
Sometimes I wish that you'd still call me up
So I can pretend like I don't give a fuck about you
'Cause I'm not around you

I wish I could get back all of that time (all of that time)
I wish I never found out what it's like
To love someone and lose 'em
I feel so fucking stupid
What a convincing illusion
What a convincing illusion (what a convincing illusion)

I wish I never let you in my life (in my life)
I wish I never found out what it's like
To love someone and lose 'em
I feel so fucking stupid
What a convincing illusion
What a convincing illusion

Oh
What a convincing illusion
